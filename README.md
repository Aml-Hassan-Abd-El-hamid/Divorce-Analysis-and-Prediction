In this project I conduct an analysis for the divorce dataset from Kaggle, you can find the dataset in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/divorce-prediction

## About this dataset:

This dataset contains data about 150 couples with their corresponding Divorce Predictors Scale variables (DPS) on the basis of Gottman couples therapy.

The couples are from various regions of Turkey wherein the records were acquired from face-to-face interviews with couples who were already divorced or happily married.

All responses were collected on a 5 point scale (0=Never, 1=Seldom, 2=Averagely, 3=Frequently, 4=Always).

## Stages of the project:

- Cheaking and cleaning the data.
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Modeling.

## Cheaking and cleaning the data:

This dataset has 54 features and one target which is labelled as "divorce" which has a value of zero for not-divorced and one for divorced.

The original dataset has 170 rows, but there were duplicates in the dataset so after removing those duplicated rows, I was left with 150 rows. 

The dataset got no missing values.
